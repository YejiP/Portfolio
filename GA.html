Those are courses we have for comming semester, and we want to match room and time for each courses without any problems.

<br>
One possible solution might be represented as the table below.
<img src = 'GA/img/possible.PNG' width="300px">
Then, what should we think when we schedule this task?

<img src = 'GA/img/c2.PNG' width="200px">

Constraints
<br>1. Each Prof, at most 1 class at one period
<br>2. Each Students group, at most 1 class at one period
<br>3. Room capacity >= students of course.
<br>4. Room cannot be double booked.
<br>
Evaluation function : 1/(1+number of constraints)
If evaluation function is equal to 1, then it can be possible solution.

eval =1

eval = 1/(1+3)=0.25

<div id =title ><h3>1. The concept of Genetic Algorithm</h3><br></div>

<div id = text>Genetic algorithm is the way of finding the answer imitating the genetic system.
All people get their genetic information from their parents, half from mom and half from dad. and sometimes, mutation occurs which can change the genetic information.
In the Genetic Algorithm , each individual contains the information of answer. It does not have to be right.
Each individual is now evaluated how much it is close to the correct answer. Depends on the fitness value of individual, it varies the chance of being parents.
Then, How can we represent this information of courses and the classes for each individual? We can use array.
Let‚Äôs say there are 7 courses. ü°™ create 7 spots for each courses.
Array which contains ‚ÄúClass‚Äù classes	 ü°™ Class[7]
So first spot represents 1st course, second spot 2nd course.

Now, we need to initialize population. Population is the group of individuals which contain information in the chromosome.
<img src = 'GA/img/pop.PNG'  width="200px">
and based on this, if there is the answer in that population, stop searching and return the answer,
If there is no answer exists, then It will make another generation by selection, cross over, mutaton.

selection:
There are some diverse selection methods such as rank order, russian rullette and etc, but I used rank order selection.
Pick several individuals and pick the best one.

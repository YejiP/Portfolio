# OSI Model Overall

- OSI Model consists of 7 layers. 

  -  physical , data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application

    (**P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**each **S**tudents **P**ointless **A**bbreviation!)

# Layer 1) Physical

```
Bits, Medium, Wiring standards, Physical topology, 
Synchronizing bits, Bandwidth usage, Multiplexing strategy 
```

- physical and electrical characteristics.

## **How are bits represented on the medium?**

1. Electrical voltage or light
2. Current State
3. Transition Modulation

## **How are the cables wired?**

- 2 std inside of network. 
- TIA/EIA-568-B is standard wiring for RJ-45 cables and ports (?)
- **cross over cable :** A std - Bstd 
- **straing-thru cable :** B std - B std or A std - A std

## **How are the cables connected?**

- add pros/cons on the picture

## **How is communication synchronized?**

- **Asynchronous :** uses start/stop bits to notify transmission occured.
- **Synchronous :** uses a reference clock to coordinate the transmission

## **How is bandwidth utilized?**

- **broadband** : like TV channel. we only pulled out the ones we wanted
- **baseband** : like telephone, using all of the bandwidth allocated to that phone line, reference clock. (example of synchronous communication)

## Layer 1 Devices

- **Cables** : Ethernet, Fiber optic
- **Radio frequencies** : Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
- **Infrastructure devices** : Hubs, Wireless Access Points, Media Converters

# Layer 2) Data Link

```
MAC, Physical addressing, Logical topology, Method of Transmission, LLC, Flow control
```

- data --(Data Link)--> frames
- Error detection/correction
- identification of network devices with an address (MAC)

## **Media Access Control (MAC)**

- Physical addressing.
  - **First 24-bits :** the vendor code 
  - **Second 24-bits :** a unique value
  - Hexadecimal number system

- Logical topology
  - It can identify topology of how the network wired together logically.

## **Logical Link Control (LLC)**

- Acknowledgement of receipt of a message

- **Flow control** : controls the load of data to optimize the performance. (Ex. Downloading Videos. The downloading speed keeps changing)
- **Error control** : sends again if the data is not received or coruppted.

## **How is communication synchronized?**

(learn more to understand fully)

- **Isochronous** :
  - create time slots by using a common reference clock source.
  - Less overhead(?) than other two method.
- **Synchronous** :
  - uses clocking method to indicate start/end of frames.
- **Asynchronous** :
  - uses their own internal clocks and use start/stop bits.

## **Layer 2 Devices**

- Network Interface Cards (NIC)
- Bridges
- Switches

# Layer 3) Network

```
Logical address, Switching (not SWITCH), Route discovery and selection, Connection services, Bandwidth usage, Multiplexing strategy 
```

- forward traffic with logical address such as IP Address.

## **Logical address**

- Internet Protocol(IP) is dominantly used. (IP v4, IP v6)

## **How should data be forwarded or routed?**

(learn more to understand fully)

- **Packet swtiching (routing)** : Data is divided into packets and forwarded.
- **Circuit switching** : Dedicated communication link is established between two devices
- **Message switching** : Data is divided into messages. 

? what is the difference between Packet switching and Message switching?

## **Route Discovery and Selection** 

```
Routing table, Routing Protocol
```

- A routing table contains info about where to forward a packet based on destination IP address.
- Manually configured as a static route or dynamically through a routing protocol (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP) --> ?

## **Connection Services** 

-  Layer 3 augment Layer 2 to improve reliability 
- Flow control, Packet reordering (how does it work in detail? with LLC in layer 2?) 

## **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** 

- sends error messages and operational info about an IP destination
- Used in troubleshooting (ping and traceroute)

### **Layer 3 Devices/Protocols**

- Routers 
- Multilayer switches 
- IPv4 protocol / IPv6 protocol / Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

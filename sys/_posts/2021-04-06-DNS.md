# DNS (Domain Name System)

- People type Domain name to access to the server, but IP address is what computer needs when they request/send data.

- Therefore, DNS should be converted into IP address. It is not too simple, because computers cannot have tons of DNS-IP matching info in their memory. They request DNS server to get IP info.

- For example, **google.com** , There is invisible . at the end of 'com', so it is **google.com.** 

  - . is root domain and it is usually hidden

  - DNS is needed to be interpret backwards.  

    - .  =>  com  =>  google
    - It has a tree structure.

## **How is it propagated around internet?**

- Domain name has a tree structure. 

  - From the top, Root => Top-level DN => Second level DN => SubDN

- Types of DNS Server

  1. DNS recursive resolver : It is served by ISP(Internet Service Provider)
  2. Root name server
  3. Top Level Domain/ TLD name server
  4. Authoritative name server

- ex) When we type 'google.com',

  - First, It goes to '.' Root server to find out TLD name server IP.

    - If it is google.com. then in this step, It will return the IP of .com TLD Name server.

  - And then , TLD IP address returns to the computer, and computer again sends request to look for google. 

  - This process repeats until It hits Authoritative name server(?) and return the IP address.

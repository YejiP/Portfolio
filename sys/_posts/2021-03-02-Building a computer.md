# **Components**

```
Motherboard, CPU, Storage, Memory, Power supply, GPU
```

**motherboard** : It seems like each motherboard has different configuration. 

Q) so if I want to build a computer for certain purpose, such as gaming computer or AI computer, then do I need to look for specific type of mother board? or no need to? just buying good components corresponding to the usage would be fine?

**a CPU** : Central Processing Unit. It sockets directly into motherboard.

**Storage** : m.2 SSD 

**Memory** : RAM (Random Access Memory. Not REM,,, That is Rapid Eye Movement..)

**power supply** : It determines how quick and powerful your PC can be.

**GPU** : Graphics Processing Unit

**a case and monitor**

# Before getting started, 

Connect yourself to power supply metal part using anti-static strap. It will prevent **ESD sensitive components**  from getting damaged.

** ESD : Electrostatic-Sensitive Device

# Learning from YT video 

1. Put CPU on the motherboard.
2. 2 memory + m.2 SD card(change size2 phillip to size 1 phillip?)
3. Cooler, if you want to overclocking, then get expensive one. putting above CPU

4. Motherboard has  a CPU fan connector. put it near or above the cooler.
5. from the video, It seems like power supply comes with the case. (?) , and case has cables. 
6. case and fan.. lots of fans. connect power cable from the case to motherboard.
7. install motherboard to the case. but before it, put IO shields first to the case.
8. fix it well, and then start to connect cables.
9. braid cables and put each cables into motherboard.
11. Insert SATA SSD into the case until it clicks. Then connect SATA data cable to motherboard.
12. install power supply(Now done with ESD , so take off the anti-static strap.) and connects power supply cable to the motherboard.
13.  PCI express connector
14. SATA power (hard drive, integrated RGB controller)
15. I/O disk, Is it linked to Graphic card

** PCI express :  an interface that connects internal expansion cards such as graphics cards, sound cards, Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters to the **motherboard**. [source](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/pci-express-pcie/)

** Overclocking : Overclocking is the action of increasing a componentâ€™s clock rate, **running it at a higher speed than it was designed to run**. This is usually applies to the CPU or GPU, but other components can also be overclocked.

motherboard

 : seems like each motherboard has different configuration. so if i want to build a computer for certain purpose, such as gaming computer, AI computer and so on, then How do I know which is good to choose?

(I guess It is not big of a deal for now ,but still curious.)



a CPU

: Central Processing Unit. It sockets directly into motherboard.



storage

: m.2 SSD 



memory

: RAM 



power supply

: It determines how quick and powerful your PC can be.



a case

: cover



a monitor

GPU

Before getting started, 

1. I should connect myself to power supply metal part by anti-static stap. (may be to prevent from damaging electrical sensitive computer parts?) --> yes, It seems like it is called **ESD sensitive components** (electrostatic-**sensitive** device)



start

1. put CPU on the motherboard.
2. 2 memory + m.2 SD card(change size2 phillip to size 1 phillip?)
3. cooler, if you want to overclocking, then get expensive one..?, putting over CPU ,

4. motherboard has CPU fan connector. put it near? or over cooler.
5. from the video, It seems like power supply comes with the case. (?) , and case has cables (which is too obvious..!)
6. case and fan.. lots of fans. connect power cable from the case to motherboard.
7. install motherboard to the case. but before it, put IO shields first to the case.
8. fix it well, and then start to connect cables.
9. braid? cables , and put each cables into motherboard.
10. ? cd?
11. SATA data cable
12. power supply box and power supply cable. (connects to the motherboard)
13.  pci express
14. SATA power (hard drive, intergrated RGB controller)
15. I/O disk? --> linked to Graphic card ??



pci express :  an interface that connects internal expansion cards such as graphics cards, sound cards, Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters to the **motherboard**. (https://www.digitalcitizen.life/pci-express-pcie/)

overclocking : Overclocking is the action of increasing a componentâ€™s clock rate, running it at a higher speed than it was designed to run. This is usually applies to the CPU or GPU, but other components can also be overclocked.

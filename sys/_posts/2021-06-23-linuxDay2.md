/ : "root", the top of the file system hierarchy
/bin : Binaries and other executable programs
/etc : System configuration files
/home : Home directories (/home/callie => 내 account 데이터를 저장)
/opt : optional or third party software. (sw that is not bundled with the OS)
/tmp : Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot
/usr : User related programs
/var : Variable data, most notably log files
/var/log : Log files
```

```
/boot : Files needed to boot the operating system
/cdrom : Mount point for CD-ROMs.
/dev : device files, typically controlled by the OS and the sys admin
/export : shared file systems
/lib : system libraries
/lib64 : system libraries, 64bit
/lost+found : Used by the file system to store recovered files after a file system check has been performed.
/media : Used to mount removable media like CD-ROMs
/mnt : Used to mount external file systems
/proc : Provides info about running processes
/sbin : System administration binaries
/selinux : Used to display information about SELinux

  - There will always be a command line
  - Server distributions do not include GUIs.
  - Desktop distributions have GUIs and CLIs

- The prompt
  - $ : Normal user
  - \# : Super user root@linuxsvr (superuser account)

- Tilda Expansion
  - ~callie = /home/callie
  - ~pat = /home/pat
  - ~root = /root
  - ~ftp = /srv/ftp
